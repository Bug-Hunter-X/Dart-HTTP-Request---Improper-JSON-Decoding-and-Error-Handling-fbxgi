# Dart HTTP Request: Improper JSON Decoding and Error Handling

This repository demonstrates a common error in Dart applications when handling HTTP requests and JSON responses. The `bug.dart` file shows incorrect JSON decoding and error handling that can lead to unexpected behavior or crashes.

The `bugSolution.dart` file provides a corrected version with improved error handling and more robust JSON parsing, demonstrating how to safely handle different JSON response structures and appropriately manage errors.
